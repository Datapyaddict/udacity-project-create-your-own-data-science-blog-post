### Project info

The purpose of this project is to analyse a dataset from Trip Advisor found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw). 

It contains interesting information about 125K restaurants, mostly regarding the city of the restaurant, their rating, their number of reviews, some customer reviews about them, the cuisine styles they offer and the price range they are associated to. The data date back to 2017-2018.

The questions we would like to answer through this analysis are :
- If I travel in a city in Europe, what should I know about the eating out market in the city?
- What are the most global cities in terms of variety of cuisines?
- If I want to eat in a highly rated restaurant, can I expect to find some budget friendly restaurants?
- Is there a relationship between the rating of a restaurant and the number of reviews?Â 
- What can the words in customer reviews tell me about the customers sentiment for a given cuisine style in a city?


The python version used to run the code is 3.9.7.
The analysis is done through a Jupyter notebook.
The modules used in the notebook are :
- pandas,
- matplotlib,
- seaborn 
- wordcloud
